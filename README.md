# Pymaceuticals, Inc. - Clinical Study Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes data from a recent animal study conducted by Pymaceuticals, Inc. on treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in mice. The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Pymaceuticals' drug, Capomulin, compared to other treatment regimens over a 45-day period.

## Files
- **pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb**: Main Jupyter Notebook containing code for data analysis and visualizations.
- **Mouse_metadata.csv**: Metadata on the mice used in the study.
- **Study_results.csv**: Tumor size data over time for each treatment regimen.

## Key Analysis
- Summary statistics for each drug regimen.
- Tumor volume comparisons across treatments.
- Gender distribution of mice.
- Visualizations including bar charts, pie charts, box plots, and scatter plots.
- Correlation and regression analysis for Capomulin regimen.

## Results Summary
Capomulin showed strong effectiveness in reducing tumor sizes compared to other treatments, with consistent results across different mice. Capomulin and Ramicane had the lowest average tumor volumes.

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to reproduce the analysis and visualizations. Ensure all data files are in the same directory as the notebook.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scipy

## Resources and Support
- For this project, I used multiple resources to ensure the successful completion of the assignment:

ChatGPT (AI Assistant): For guidance on code logic, debugging, structuring the scripts and formatting my Readme file.
Xpert Learning Assistant: For debugging and grasping concepts and formula sequence.
Tutoring Sessions: I completed a tutoring session to further refine my understanding of coding, project requirements and Github.
All external resources used are listed here for transparency.
